You have a number **N** of magic stones, each of which has a level with a positive integer value.

The stones are very heavy and cumbersome to carry around.

Luckily, you can use your magic powers to combine two stones of level **i** to form a single stone of level **i+1**.

Use your power to minimize the number of stones that you have.

### Usage

You can run mstone.py directly with the python3 interpreter by providing a list as an input argument.

Ex: python mstone.py [0,1,2]

You can also execute mstone-test.py with no arguments to try the script against known inputs and answers.
