## Question Description

Implement the _uniqueNames_ method. When passed two arrays of names, it will return an array containing the names that appear in **either or both** arrays. The returned array should have no duplicates.

For example, calling
```
MergeNames.uniqueNames(new String[]{'Ava','Emma','Olivia'}, new String[]{'Olivia','Sophia','Emma'})
```
should return an array containing Ava, Emma, Olivia, and Sophia in any order.

## Notes

Again there isn't much to say. This was also considered **"Easy"** and was a very quick solve. I originally wrote it with _while_ loops but at the time of writing this readme, cut 3 lines by changing to _for_ loops. Always looking for ways to make code more concise.
