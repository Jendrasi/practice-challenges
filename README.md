## Programming Practice & Challenges

This repo is entirely for my own practice at programming. Everything here is written and documented by and for myself, for job search material, and to help others learn. The chosen language will likely change from project to project. I will thoroughly explain each problem in the challenge README and/or in the comments of the code itself. Most challenges will be directly pulled from or inspired by existing problems.
